    2. Easy to code
    3. Easy to maintain
    4. Reusing of code became easy
    5. Declarative ,robust and easy to use
    6. Was easy to learn
    7. It made a huge community of developers in very less time so support was high


- One of the main reasons of react's success was the new feature called Virtual DOM, which made it popular among the developers
What exactly is the virtual DOM :
Virtual dom is a concept created by react where react creates a copy of DOM and for all real DOM changes done via code it doesnt change the real DOM ,instead all the changes are made to virtual DOM.
Whenever the repaint of browsers happen virtual dom just changes those part of real dom which has some changes and not the whole DOM is rendered.
