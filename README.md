Documenting my journey of taking up 75 days non-stop incremental practise/learning of concepts.

Starting with an attempt to do 75 Days of Javascript.
Since it is my first attempt, i have decided to follow the content posted by someone on linkedin.

Begining an additional challenge, plan to spend atleast 30 mins a day watching video/ making notes/ solving sums. Reason to start with binary search onwards is coz in several previous attempts, i've never gone past binary search.
