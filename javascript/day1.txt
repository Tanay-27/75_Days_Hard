Title: Execution Context and Call Stack

Notes:

- While executing the global execution context, if function is encountered.
JS creates its own new functional execution context. In browser context, if code is executing in strict mode,
the value of this is undefined, else it is window object in function execution context/

Call Stack or Execution Context Stack (ECS) LIFO Data structure to store all execution stacks created during life cycle of script.
